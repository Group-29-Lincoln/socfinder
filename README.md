# Society Finder 🐝

## Description ❓
This aims to provide a better way for people to meet in university. The thing that really gets people together in university is society's , but the main issue is that people don't know what society to join. This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to pair people with society's that they might not be interested in but have a common ground with the people inside of it. This would encourage them to get involved learn new skills or interests as well as meeting new people.
